Design status at the time of release: four prototypes built; bring-up in progress

Expected future releases: 
  V1A - description of all required patches
  V2  - new PCB design to consolidate V1A patches

Updates to improve the readability of the schematic diagram are done as needed; they are not distinct releases.
